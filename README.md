# Keep-Alive Render Loop

## (Still in Testing)
- My 7900XT driver kept failing and system freezing. So I decided to try and remedy this by giving it some utilisation when idle.
- Is your AMD GPU crashing on minimal usage desktop applications?

## Features

- ✔ Zero UI distraction – Runs invisibly in the system tray
- 🐢 Low (120 MAX FPS): Gentle on power usage
- 🚗 Medium (1250 MAX FPS): Balanced performance
- 🚀 High (Unlimited): Maximum GPU utilization
- 👣 Micro footprint – <1% CPU usage, ~20MB RAM

## Usage

1. Run KARenderLoop.exe (no admin rights needed)
2. Check your system tray
3. Right-click the tray icon to configure
